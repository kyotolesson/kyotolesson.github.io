                            I am a life-long lover of language, having studied Linguistics and Japanese at the
                            University of Sydney. <br><br>
                            I have written and performed original stand-up comedy for over two years, debuting an
                            hour-long solo show at the 2019 Melbourne Fringe Festival,
                            as well as co-writing, directing, and sound-designing on indepedent theatre productions
                            across the Melbourne scene.
                            I've also been writing stories, poetry, and lyrics for my musical compositions for over 10
                            years. <br><br>
                            I am passionate about helping kids to find new, exciting ways to express themselves,
                            whatever form that may take. <br><br>
                            My fascination with all things Japanese has led me at last to Kyoto, where I'm excited to

                        <p>
                            Learning to code has been one of the most fulfilling achievements of my life.<br><br>

                            Several years ago, I taught myself Python as a way to automate repetitive tasks at a desk
                            job. In 2019, I moved to Kyoto and attended an adult web development bootcamp,
                            which, incidentally, was in the same building as Kyoto Lesson! After this, I taught students
                            in subsequent classes and found
                            this experience incredibly fun.<br><br>

                            In my career, I've explored the tech scene in Silicon Valley and built movie props in LA.
                            Now I find myself at a startup in Kyoto, contributing to the company's web projects and
                            coaching the CEO on his English. I enjoy working with diverse groups of people and
                            giving them the tools they need to succeed. At Kyoto Lesson, I aim to share my hunger for
                            learning and taking on new challenges.<br><br>

                            I have always enjoyed teaching. I tutored students when I was in high school and I’ve worked
                            at an English conversation school for the past four years.
                            Teaching is one of my biggest passions, but I also love art, design, literature, culture,
                            and people in general.<br><br>

                            I am half-Japanese and half-American. I grew up in South Carolina until I was 13 and moved
                            to Gunma, Japan for junior and senior high school.
                            I moved to Kyoto after I was accepted into Doshisha University. I’m currently still studying
                            sociology there while working part-time.<br><br>

                            I really feel that English education in Japan focuses too much on studying from textbooks
                            and getting high scores.
                            Language is so much fun and I want to share this with children who are trying to learn
                            English in Japan.
                            I’m excited to work in a totally new environment and combine study with play.<br><br>

                            I am currently studying at the French International School Kyoto. Computer science is one of
                            my major.
                            I am both French and Japanese and fluent in both languages. I grew up in Europe and moved to
                            Kyoto about 10 years ago. <br><br>
                            I have a passion for soccer and fast vehicles. Only by the time I was legally allowed to own
                            one, did I realise that nice motorbikes or cars were rather expensive!
                            And that's one of the reasons I've decided to study on my own both finance and computer
                            science,
                            two fields where I thought I could quickly monetize my knowledge and expertise. <br><br>
                            The positive side effect was that I really enjoyed both fields and ever since I want to
                            learn more about both and
                            most importantly, I want to also share this knowledge with others. This is what brought me
                            to teaching and
                            I look forward to teaching coding to other students too!

                            Growing up, I had a handful of teachers who inspired me to be a teacher as well. So, I went
                            to school to get a double masters in Childhood Education and TESOL,
                            and after a trip to Japan in 2012, knew what I wanted with my future.<br><br>

                            When it comes to kids, I believe they can achieve anything and that they are only limited by
                            their imagination and drive. I believe my role as an educator is to help
                            them unlock their potential and enjoy learning through various mediums such as play,
                            stories, music, activity, etc.<br><br>

                            I love exploring and learning new things, and am a bit of a bookworm. (I rigorously study
                            J.R.R. Tolkien in my free time), and am also passionate about martial arts,
                            cinema, and music.<br><br>

                            I’m excited for new opportunities, and am always looking for ways to learn and improve my
                            teaching methods to adapt and assist the upcoming generation, giving them
                            the confidence to become global citizens<br><br>

                            I love both learning languages and teaching them in general. I am fluent in English and
                            Japanese, and I am also studying French and Korean as I'd like to be a
                            multilingual speaker. I have had exposure to English ever since I was one year old and I
                            have experience working as an English tutor, and TA at high school in the past
                            four years. <br><br>

                            I was born in Saitama, but I grew up overseas. I spent four years in Hong Kong, three years
                            in India, and two years in Dubai. I moved to Kyoto for senior high school.
                            I studied in Houston for a year as an exchange student during my high school life, and I
                            also studied at The University of British Columbia before graduating high
                            school. I am currently a fourth year student of Ritsumeikan University and majoring in
                            International Relations. <br><br>

                            Speaking is the most important way to study English. The reason why I like languages is
                            because there is lots of fun to have conversations with many people with
                            different backgrounds. I am looking forward to sharing my experience overseas. <br><br>

                            I have worked with children for over 30 years and especially focus on fostering children's
                            creativity and sense of play. I also have experience in computer science and several other
                            science-related fields. I've started coding at the age of 10, and I was part of the first
                            generation of "computer whiz kids".<br><br>

                            My work with kids has included afterschool teacher, camp counselor, and kindergarten teacher
                            in
                            both U.S. and Japan. My experience with computers includes applications in cobol, html,
                            javascript, among others. I am also active as staff for a scientific society in
                            Japan.<br><br>

                            I was born and grew up in Europe, but moved to the U.S. when I was 7.
                            I speak French, Portuguese and American Sign Language, and basic Japanese.
                            I live with my wife and daughter in Kyoto.<br><br>

                        <p>
                            I believe that coding is an essential skill that all children should pick up, as early as
                            possible.
                            So when we moved to Kyoto with my wife and four kids, one of the first thing I look for was
                            a proper
                            coding school for my children. I wanted a school where children would think by themself and
                            learn by doing.
                            As I could not find anything satisfying, I decided to take the matter into my own hands and
                            to start a coding school.
                            And that's how Kyoto Lesson was born. <br><br>
                            I am originally from France and studied in the U.S. Before moving to Kyoto, I was working as
                            a trader for over 15 years in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore.
                            During my career in banks, I had to teach myself to code as this allowed me to automate
                            several repeatitive tasks I had to do as a trader.
                            Since then, I've never stopped coding.<br>

                            However, although I specialize in literature, I was able during the camp to experiment it
                            and that really sharpened my interest for this subject.
                            It was a very rewarding and most probably valuable experience in the long run. I'd like to

                            My son has joined the Coding Boot Camp twice so far. Unlike other programming schools,
                            Kyoto Lesson teaches students the fundamentals of coding in a very easy-to-understand way,
                            such as encrypting information when sending emails over the Internet as well as sorting
                            algorithm. It's not just coding a game with Scratch. Students learn way beyond that.<br>
                            As far as English is concerned, most of the students come from international schools with a
                            very good level of English and have no problem taking the course. In addition, Alan explains
                            in a simple and easy to understand way. Many students are Japanese, hence even if you are
                            not
                            good at English, you can join too.<br>
                            On the last day of the coding boot camp, students give a presentation in English in front of
                            the parents, to present their project and explain what they learned from their class.<br>
                            Every day during the boot camp, Alan sent us by e-mail a very detailed explanation of what
                            the students had done during the day. This is very interesting to read for parents and
                            allows
                            you to follow what students are doing.

                            I've registered my children to the coding school as I thought it could be more meaningful
                            for
                            their future rather than playing video games.<br><br>

                            At first they learnt the basic of block programming and animations in Scratch.
                            Then they moved on to more advanced skills while having fun modifying the popular video game
                            Minecraft. The students need to think about the code they have to write in order to change
                            or
                            do something in the video game. After that, the students started to build their own website.
                            When I listen to my children, I feel that they are having a lot of fun while shaping their
                            thoughts to build what they imagine.<br><br>

                            Alan is teaching the lesson. He has a way to fluently alternate between one-on-one teaching
                            and
                            group work/discussion. He is teaching fluently both in English and French. Alan's rich
                            experience
                            and knowledge brings to the class an international, cutting-edge teaching. This is an
                            amazing
                            plus for the class.<br><br>

                            The ability to foster and create such logical thinking will prepare children for the future
                            and
                            will bring them skills that are very relevant in the age of Artificial Intelligence.

                            After few months going to Kyōto Lessons, my 8 year old son started to understand how to make
                            simple games with Scratch, create artefacts in Minecraft and his own small webpage.
                            His interest is growing thanks to the hands-on lessons stimulating both logical thinking
                            and creativity. <br><br>
                            Through seemingly casual fun time, bits of academic knowledge and structured thinking get
                            acquired. <br><br>
                            Warmly recommended to all curious kids!<br><br>

                            Computer Science skills, especially coding skills are very useful to create web
                            applications.
                            I have therefore been looking for a good school that can teach these to my son. <br><br>

                            Alan, the founder of Kyoto lesson, has acquired very practical and extremely relevant coding
                            skills through his profesional experience and could thus design an ideal curriculum. On top
                            of
                            that he is very good at teaching.<br><br>

                            Alan is teaching basic coding logic through very practical projects. In contrast with other
                            coding schools that my son attended previously, Alan takes as much time as needed to let
                            students find solutions by themself, rather than just making them copy lines of codes
                            without
                            thinking. The things he wants to teach them is process and inquiry. This is what I like very
                            much about this school!<br><br><br>

                            </a>. These camps are intensive classes, 3-hour per day over 5 days.
                            Students will work as a team on a project that they will aim to complete by the end of the
                            boot camp.<br><br>

                            The goal in these boot camps is to find a solution to a real-world problem either faced by a
                            company, a non-profit or related to a student's interest. <br><br>

                            Students will start with Scratch, a visual programming language developed by one of the
                            research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) before diving into
                            JavaScript and Python, two programming languages extensively used by software developers.

                        In the Fantasy Newspaper children create a newspaper. <br><br>
                        Throughout the project, children take on a variety of roles, such as editor, reporter, copy
                        editor,
                        photographer, artist, and publisher.
                        <br><br>
                        At the same time, children assign themselves departments like Current Events, Theater, Science,
                        Opinion.
                        <br><br>
                        Wearing different hats gives children the chance to express and develop their language skills

                            Computer hardware and electronic are essential components of Computer Science.
                            As you improve your coding skills, you will need to understand what are the various hardware
                            limitations you are exposed
                            to in order to write a more efficient code.
                            <br><br>
                            With the Internet of Things (or IoT) becoming an important area of research across the
                            globe, hardware prototyping is
                            especially relevant nowadays and a logical addition to our curriculum.
                            <br><br>
                            Our Hardware curriculum focuses on giving our students a hands-on maker experience.
                            Our students are making actual objects from sketching all the way to the actual prototype
                            and our program is splitted into three main parts:
                            <br><br>

                            This is one of the key future technologies, enabling businesses to cut costs, reduce time to
                            market,
                            produce stronger and lighter parts, improve efficiency, and solve a myriad of other

                            Our curriculum is meant to bring non-technical students to a level that allows them to
                            independtly build their own product.
                            During that journey, they will learn the best approach to problem solving and the technics
                            to quickly assess the potential of their idea, test their hypothesis, minimize their risk,
                            design and build a MVP and then iterate from there.
                            We focus only on the most relevant and up-to-date tools used across the Tech Industry.

                            Our Tech Entrepreneurs will learn how to write production ready code and how to lead others.
                            During this immersive startup program, they will interact with different roles at the
                            company
                            (engineers, designers, product managers, project managers) and they will also have a chance
                            to be
                            one of them if they choose to. At the end of the sprint, each team demo their progress in
                            front
                            of the product manager. At the end of the class the teams will have the opportunity to
                            present
                            their final product.

                        <h3>Two Programs, Flexible Learning</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our Tech Entrepreneurs are often full-time University students with non-technical major.
                            We have thus designed our program in the most flexible way possible to insure that it is
                            compatible
                            with their otherwise busy schedule.
                            <br><br>
                            Each session consists of a class followed by a short project to be completed by the students
                            at home or in the class, alone or as a group.
                            <br><br>
                            Through our program, students will acquire two essential skills: building web applications
                            (JavaScript) as well as data-driven decision tools (Python).<br><br>
                            Each skill is further split into 3 sub-skills, so that our Tech Entrepreneurs can learn at
                            their own
                            pace. While it is best to have these 3 sub-skills completed in a short time-interval, we
                            also
                            understand that this might not always be possible when studying for another degree in
                            parallel.<br><br>
                            To complete each skill, our students will further be able to chose between two programs:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Intensive Boot Camp program (3hr+3hr/day, 5d/week for 12 weeks, ¥600,000) </li>
                            <li>Continuous Learning program (4hr+4hr/day, 2d/week for 24 weeks, ¥675,000)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            A new class will start once at least six students have registered.

                        <p>
                            To be successful at something you need to be surrounded by experts that guide you along the
                            way.
                            That’s exactly what we did with the design of our immersive startup class. Instead of the
                            traditional
                            approach where students sit in a formal classroom, learn the theory first, and solve
                            fictitious
                            problems, our students are essentially software engineers that works for a startup and
                            create actual
                            products. They will need to solve real-world problems through decomposing, researching
                            independently
                            as well as managing their projects. The more academic part of the teaching will come only as
                            and when
                            needed to keep their projects moving forward. This environment, technologies, and processes
                            are
                            identical to successful startups and companies around the world.

                            more advanced classes, we'll be working on projects in collaboration with some of the
                            largest tech companies (Google,
                            Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Uber, Airbnb...), smaller startups (local and foreign) as well as
